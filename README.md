# Relectric Object Detection

A feature on Relectric’s 1966 Volvo P220, created by the Geomatics Team in 2022-2023 academic year at University of Calgary.

This year, we intended to design a back-up camera with built-in object detection. Instead of using last year’s design of superimposed parking lines in the backup camera, we used OpenCV (a Python library) to determine objects with the camera.
